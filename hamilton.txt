1. ALEXANDER HAMILTON
AARON BURR
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
JOHN LAURENS
The ten-dollar founding father without a father got a lot farther by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter, by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter.
THOMAS JEFFERSON
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up. Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of, the brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow or barter.
JAMES MADISON
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned, our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain, put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain, and he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain.
BURR
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man” took up a collection just to send him to the mainland. “Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and the world is gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”
ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton. My name is Alexander Hamilton. And there’s a million things I haven’t done, but just you wait, just you wait . . .
ELIZA HAMILTON
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden, two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden, half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick,
COMPANY
And Alex got better but his mother went quick.
GEORGE WASHINGTON
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide. Left him with nothin’ but ruined pride, something new inside, a voice saying, “You gotta fend for yourself.”
COMPANY
“Alex,
he started retreatin’ and readin’ every treatise on the shelf.
you gotta fend for yourself.”
BURR
There would have been nothin’ left to do
for someone less astute, he woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution, started workin’, clerkin’ for his late mother’s landlord, tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford scammin’ for every book he can get his hands on,
COMPANY
Scammin’
plannin’ for the future see him now as he stands on Plannin’ the bow of a ship headed for a new land,
Oooh…
In New York you can be a new man.

2. AARON BURR, SIR
COMPANY
1776. New York City.
HAMILTON
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?
BURR
That depends. Who’s asking?
HAMILTON
Oh, well, sure, sir, I’m Alexander Hamilton, I’m at your service, sir. I have been looking for you.
BURR
I’m getting nervous.
HAMILTON
Sir… I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It’s a blur, sir. He handles the financials?
BURR
You punched the bursar.
HAMILTON
Yes! I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I’m not stupid.
So how’d you do it? How’d you graduate so fast?
BURR
It was my parents’ dying wish before they passed.
HAMILTON
You’re an orphan. Of course! I’m an orphan. God, I wish there was a war! Then we could prove that we’re worth more than anyone bargained for…
BURR
Can I buy you a drink?
HAMILTON
That would be nice.
BURR
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice. Talk less.
HAMILTON
What?
BURR
Smile more.
HAMILTON
Ha.
BURR
Don’t let them know what you’re against or what you’re for.
HAMILTON
You can’t be serious.
BURR
You wanna get ahead?
HAMILTON
Yes.
BURR
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead.

LAURENS
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?
LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN
Show time!
BURR

LAURENS
Show time! Show time! Yo!

LAFAYETTE
Oui oui, mon ami, je m’appelle Lafayette! The Lancelot of the revolutionary set! I came from afar just to say “Bonsoir!” Tell the King “Casse toi!” Who’s the best? C’est moi!
MULLIGAN
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan, Up in it, lovin’ it, yes I heard ya mother said “Come again?” Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course it’s hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets…

LAURENS

BURR
Good luck with that: you’re takin’ a stand. You spit. I’m ‘a sit. We’ll see where we land.
LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN

LAURENS
Burr, the revolution’s imminent. What do you stall for?
HAMILTON
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?

I’m ‘a get a scholarship to King’s College. I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish. The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish. I gotta holler just to be heard. With every word, I drop knowledge! I’m a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
tryin’ to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable. Only nineteen but my mind is older. These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder ev’ry burden, ev’ry disadvantage I have learned to manage, I don’t have a gun to brandish, I walk these streets famished. The plan is to fan this spark into a flame. But damn, it’s getting dark, so let me spell out the name, I am the—
HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/ LAURENS
A-l-e-x-a-n-d e-r—we are—meant to be...
HAMILTON
A colony that runs independently. Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin’ on us endlessly. Essentially, they tax us relentlessly, then King George turns around, runs a spending spree. He ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free, so there will be a revolution in this century. Enter me!
LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS
(He says in parentheses)
HAMILTON
Don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book mentions me. I will lay down my life if it sets us free. Eventually, you’ll see my ascendancy,

HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/ MULLIGAN

BURR
Geniuses, lower your voices. You keep out of trouble and you double your choices. I’m with you, but the situation is fraught. You’ve got to be carefully taught: If you talk, you’re gonna get shot!
HAMILTON
Burr, check what we got. Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot, I think your pants look hot, Laurens, I like you a lot. Let’s hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin’ the pot... What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot, poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not, a bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists? Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!
Oh, am I talkin’ too loud? Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth. I never had a group of friends before, I promise that I’ll make y’all proud.
LAURENS

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory When’s it gonna get me? In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?  comin’, do I run or do I let it be? Is it like a beat without a melody? See, I never thought I’d live past twenty. Where I come from some get half as many. Ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask, we have to make this moment last, that’s plenty.
Scratch that, this is not a moment, it’s the movement where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went? Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand, we roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land. And? If we win our independence? ‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants? Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants? I know the action in the street is excitin’, but Jesus, between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’ I’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’. We need to handle our financial situation. Are we a nation of states? What’s the state of our nation? I’m past patiently waitin’. I’m passionately smashin’ every expectation, every action’s an act of creation! I’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow, for the first time, I’m thinkin’ past tomorrow,

I’m being honest. I’m working with a third of what our Congress has promised. We are a powder keg about to explode, I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
I am not throwin’ away my shot! I am not throwin’ away my shot! Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry!
HAMILTON
I am not throwing away my shot!
WASHINGTON
Son,
WASHINGON AND COMPANY
We are outgunned, outmanned!
HAMILTON
You need all the help you can get. I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan, Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?
WASHINGTON AND COMPANY
Outnumbered, outplanned!
HAMILTON
We’ll need some spies on the inside, Some King’s men who might let some things slide.
HAMILTON COMPANY
ELI/ANG/ PEG
I’ll write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies,
Boom! Whoa, whoa, whoa…

Whoa, whoa, whoa…

9. A WINTER’S BALL
BURR
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore, go on and on, grow into more of a phenomenon? Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother be seated at the right hand of the father. Washington hires Hamilton right on sight, But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write. Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We’re reliable with the
ALL MEN
Ladies!
BURR
There are so many to deflower.
ALL MEN
Ladies!
BURR
Looks! Proximity to power.
ALL MEN
Ladies!
BURR
They delighted and distracted him. Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!
HAMILTON
That’s true.
FULL COMPANY
1780.
BURR
A winter’s ball and the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all. Yo, if you can marry a sister, you’re rich, son.
HAMILTON
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?
10. HELPLESS
HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS
Hey Hey Hey hey
HAMILTON/BURR/LAURENS/ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)

ELIZA
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight. We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night, laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!” Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom, everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume.

Oh, look at those eyes,
Look into your eyes, Oh! And the sky’s the limit Yeah, I’m I’m helpless, I know Helpless! Down for the count, And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.
I’m so into you, I’m helpless! I am so into you. Look into your eyes, And the sky’s the limit I’m helpless! I know, I’m down for the count And I’m drownin’ in ‘em. Down for the count, And I’m drownin’ in ‘em
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?
ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life.
HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.
ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler.  It’s a pleasure to meet you.
HAMILTON
Schuyler?
ANGELICA
My sister.
ELIZA
Thank you for all your service.
HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.
ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it.
ELIZA AND WOMEN
One week later
ELIZA
I’m writin’ a letter nightly. Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me. Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem.
ANGELICA
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you would share him.
ELIZA ALL WOMEN
Ha! Two weeks later, Two weeks later, In the living room stressin’, stressin’ my father’s stone-faced while you’re asking for his blessin’. blessin’. I’m dying inside, as you wine and dine and I’m tryin’ not to cry, ‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do. Oooh My father makes his way across the room to you. Oooh I panic for a second, thinking, “we’re through” Oooh But then he shakes your hand and says, “Be true” Oooh And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m

and I’m drownin’ in ‘em
helpless! Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em
HAMILTON
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name, an acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame. All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for pain, a couple of college credits and my top-notch brain. Insane, your family brings out a different side of me, Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me, no stress, my love for you is never in doubt. We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out. I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child. My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild. But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real,

and long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God, you’ll never feel so…
ALL WOMEN ELIZA Helpless!
HAMILTON
I do I do I do I do!
Eliza…

I’ve never felt so- Helpless! Hey! Yeah, yeah! Down for the count and

My life is gon’ be fine
Helpless!

I look into your eyes, Helpless! and the sky’s the limit I’m Helpless! …drownin’ in ‘em. Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em.

By your side! By your side!
To your union,
To the union! To the union! To the revolution! To the revolution!
and the hope that you provide.
You provide! You provide! You provide!
May you always...
HAMILTON AND MEN
Always– Always–
be satisfied.
Rewind– Rewind–
ANGELICA
I remember that night, I just might regret that night for the rest of my days.
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you can’t quite place,
but Alexander, I’ll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same, Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame, And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name, set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame,
FULL COMPANY
This is not a game…
HAMILTON
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.
ANGELICA
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself.
HAMILTON
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied.
ANGELICA
Is that right?
HAMILTON
I have never been satisfied.
ANGELICA
My name is Angelica Schuyler.
HAMILTON
Alexander Hamilton.
ANGELICA
Where’s your fam’ly from?

HAMILTON
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but just you wait, just you wait…
ANGELICA
So so so— so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light, it’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes, ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s a dream and it’s a bit of a dance, a bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance. I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance? He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants.
Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it! I wanna take him far away from this place, then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is...
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And I know she is...
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And her eyes are just…
ELIZA
Helpless…
ANGELICA
And I realize
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
HAMILTON
Where are you taking me?
ANGELICA
I’m about to change your life.
HAMILTON
Then by all means, lead the way.
COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)
Number one!
ANGELICA
I’m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I’m the one who has to social climb for one, so I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious, Alexander is penniless, Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less.
ELIZA
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you.
HAMILTON
Schuyler?
ANGELICA
My sister.
COMPANY
Number two!
ANGELICA
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status, I’d have to be naïve to set that aside, maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza, now that’s his bride. Nice going, Angelica, he was right, You will never be satisfied.
ELIZA
Thank you for all your service.
HAMILTON
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it.
ANGELICA
I’ll leave you to it.
COMPANY
Number three!
ANGELICA
I know my sister like I know my own mind, you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind. If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned, he’d be mine. She would say, “I’m fine”
ANGELICA AND COMPANY
She’d be lying.
ANGELICA
But when I fantasize at night it’s Alexander’s eyes, as I romanticize what might have been if I hadn’t sized him up so quickly. At least my dear Eliza’s his wife; at least I keep his eyes in my life…
ANGELICA
ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!
ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA)
To the groom! To the groom!

12. THE STORY OF TONIGHT (REPRISE)
LAURENS
I may not live to see our glory!
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
I may not live to see our glory!
LAURENS
But I’ve seen wonders great and small.
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
I’ve seen wonders great and small.
LAURENS
Cuz if the tomcat can get married,
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
If Alexander can get married—
LAURENS
There’s hope for our ass, after all!
LAFAYETTE
Raise a glass to freedom.
LAURENS/MULLIGAN
Hey! Something you will never see again!
MULLIGAN
No matter what she tells you.
LAFAYETTE
Let’s have another round tonight!
LAURENS
Raise a glass to the four of us!
LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Ho!
MULLIGAN
To the newly not poor of us!
LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/HAMILTON
Woo!
LAFAYETTE
We’ll tell the story of tonight.
LAURENS
Let’s have another round—
HAMILTON
Well, if it isn’t Aaron Burr.
BURR
Sir!
HAMILTON
I didn’t think that you would make it.
BURR
To be sure.
MULLIGAN/LAFAYETTE
Burr!
BURR
I came to say congratulations.
MULLIGAN
Spit a verse, Burr!
BURR
I see the whole gang is here.
LAFAYETTE
You are the worst, Burr!
HAMILTON
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel. I wish I had your command instead of manning George’s journal.
BURR
No, you don’t.
HAMILTON
Yes, I do.
BURR
Now, be sensible.

From what I hear, you’ve made yourself indispensible.
LAURENS
Well, well, I heard you’ve got a special someone on the side, Burr.
HAMILTON
Is that so?
LAURENS
What are you tryin’ to hide, Burr?
BURR
I should go.
HAMILTON
No, these guys should go.
LAFAYETTE
What?
LAURENS
No!
HAMILTON
Leave us alone.
MULLIGAN
Man…
HAMILTON
It’s alright, Burr. I wish you’d brought this girl with you tonight, Burr.
BURR
You’re very kind, but I’m afraid it’s unlawful, sir.
HAMILTON
What do you mean?
BURR
She’s married.
HAMILTON
I see.
BURR
She’s married to a British officer.
HAMILTON
Oh shit…
BURR
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more. I’ll see you on the other side of the war.
HAMILTON
I will never understand you. If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?
BURR
I’ll see you on the other side of the war.
HAMILTON
I’ll see you on the other side of the war.
13. WAIT FOR IT
BURR
Theodosia writes me a letter ev’ry day. I’m keeping her bed warm while her husband is away. He’s on the British side in Georgia. He’s tryin’ to keep the colonies in line. He can keep all of Georgia. Theodosia, she’s mine.
Love doesn’t discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes and we keep loving anyway. We laugh and we cry and we break and we make our mistakes. And if there’s a reason I’m by her side when so many have tried then I’m willing to wait for it. I’m willing to wait for it.
BURR
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone MEN
preacher, Preacher, preacher, preacher But there are things  that the homilies and hymns won’t teach ya.
Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was WOMEN
a genius, Genius my father commanded respect.
Respect, respect
When they died they left no instructions. Just a legacy to protect.
BURR/ENSEMBLE
Death doesn’t discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes and we keep living anyway. We rise and we fall and we break and we make our mistakes. And if there’s a reason I’m still alive when everyone who loves me has died I’m willing to wait for it. I’m willing to wait for it.
Wait for it
ENSEMBLE
Wait for it

Wait for it Wait for it
BURR
I am the one thing in life I can control

ENSEMBLE
Wait Wait Wait
BURR
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
ENSEMBLE
Climb Climb Climb
BURR
He has something to prove he has nothing to lose
ENSEMBLE
Lose Lose Lose Lose
BURR
Hamilton’s pace is relentless, he wastes no time
ENSEMBLE
Time Time Time
BURR
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn’t hesitate. He exhibits no restraint. He takes and he takes and he takes and he keeps winning anyway. He changes the game. He plays and he raises the stakes. And if there’s a reason he seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit-
BURR COMPANY
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it Wait for it Wait for...
I'm willing to wait for it…
I'm willing to-
Life doesn't discriminate

Wait for it... WOMEN Wait for it… MEN
Wait for it…. Wait for it... Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait for it… Wait...
14. STAY ALIVE
ELIZA
Stay alive...
ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN
Stay alive...
HAMILTON
I have never seen the General so despondent. I have taken over writing all his correspondence. Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.” I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses. Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance, they only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence.

WASHINGTON
The cavalry’s not coming.
HAMILTON
Sir!
WASHINGTON
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this. Provoke outrage, outright.
HAMILTON
That’s right.
WASHINGTON
Don’t engage, strike by night. Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight.
HAMILTON
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight.
WASHINGTON
Outrun.
HAMILTON
Outrun.
WASHINGTON
Outlast.
HAMILTON
Outlast.
WASHINGTON
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast.
HAMILTON
Chick-a-plao!
WASHINGTON
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past. We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast.
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE
Raise a glass!
MULLIGAN
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship.
LAFAYETTE
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship.
LAURENS
I stay at work with Hamilton, we write essays against slavery, and every day’s a test of our camaraderie and bravery.
HAMILTON
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband, we pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand. And ev’ry day,
“Sir, entrust me with a command,” and ev’ry day,
WASHINGTON
No.
HAMILTON
He dismisses me out of hand.
HAMILTON
ELIZA/ ANGELICA
Instead of me, Stay alive…
he promotes LEE
Charles Lee. Charles Lee. Makes him second-in-command:
LEE
I’m a General. Whee!!!!
HAMILTON
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone with.
HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth.
WASHINGTON
Ev’ryone attack!
LEE
Retreat!
WASHINGTON
Attack!
LEE
Retreat!
WASHINGTON
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!
LEE
But there’s so many of them!
WASHINGTON
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?! Hamilton!
HAMILTON
Ready, sir!
WASHINGTON
Have Lafayette take the lead!
HAMILTON
Yes, sir!
LAURENS
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat.
LAFAYETTE
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat.
HAMILTON
Charles Lee was left behind without a pot to piss in. He started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen:
LEE
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices

indecisive, from crisis to crisis. The best thing he can do for the revolution is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon.
COMPANY
Oo!!
WASHINGTON
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong.
HAMILTON
But, sir!
WASHINGTON
We have a war to fight, let’s move along.
LAURENS
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it.
HAMILTON
I can’t disobey direct orders.
LAURENS
Then I’ll do it. Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got.
HAMILTON
Laurens, do not throw away your shot.
15. TEN DUEL COMMANDMENTS
MEN
One, two, three, four
FULL COMPANY
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…
BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments.
FULL COMPANY
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments.
Number one!
LAURENS
The challenge: demand satisfaction. If they apologize, no need for further action.
COMPANY
Number two!
LAURENS
If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second.
HAMILTON
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned.
COMPANY
Number three!
LEE
Have your seconds meet face to face.
BURR
Negotiate a peace…
HAMILTON
Or negotiate a time and place.
BURR
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits.
COMPANY
Most disputes die, and no one shoots. Number four!
LAURENS
If they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright. Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site.
HAMILTON
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility.
BURR
You have him turn around so he can have deniability.
COMPANY
Five!
LEE
Duel before the sun is in the sky.
COMPANY
Pick a place to die where it’s high and dry, number six!
HAMILTON
Leave a note for your next of kin. Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in.
COMPANY
Seven!
LEE
Confess your sins, ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent.
COMPANY
Number eight!
LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR
Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…
BURR
Alexander.
HAMILTON
Aaron Burr, sir.
BURR
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?
HAMILTON
Sure. But your man has to answer for his words, Burr.
BURR
With his life? We both know that’s absurd, sir.

HAMILTON
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?
BURR
Okay, so we’re doin’ this.
COMPANY
Number nine!
HAMILTON
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher. Summon all the courage you require. Then count
MEN
One two three four
FULL COMPANY
Five six seven eight nine
HAMILTON/BURR
Number
COMPANY
Ten paces!
HAMILTON/BURR
Fire!
16. MEET ME INSIDE
HAMILTON
Lee, do you yield?
BURR
You shot him in the side! Yes, he yields!
LAURENS
I’m satisfied.
BURR
Yo, we gotta clear the field!
HAMILTON
Go! We won.
COMPANY
Here comes the General!
BURR
This should be fun.
WASHINGTON
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General.
BURR
Yes, sir.
WASHINGTON
Lee, you will never agree with me, but believe me, these young men don’t speak for me. Thank you for your service.
BURR
Let’s ride!
WASHINGTON
Hamilton!
HAMILTON
Sir!
WASHINGTON
Meet me inside.
COMPANY
Meet him inside! Meet him inside! Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!
WASHINGTON
Son—
HAMILTON
Don’t call me son.
WASHINGTON
This war is hard enough without infighting—
HAMILTON
Lee called you out. We called his bluff.
WASHINGTON
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south.
HAMILTON
You’re absolutely right. John should have shot him in the mouth. That would’ve shut him up.
WASHINGTON
Son—
HAMILTON
I’m notcha son—
WASHINGTON
Watch your tone. I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown.
HAMILTON (OVERLAPPING)
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway, these men take your name and they rake it through the mud.
WASHINGTON
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it.
HAMILTON
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have your titles. I don’t have your land. But, if you—
WASHINGTON
No—
HAMILTON
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war.
WASHINGTON
Or you could die and we need you alive.
HAMILTON
I’m more than willing to die—

WASHINGTON
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive—
HAMILTON
Call me son one more time—
WASHINGTON
Go home, Alexander. That’s an order from your commander.
HAMILTON
Sir—
WASHINGTON
Go home.
17. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH
ELIZA
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now. Look around, look around…
HAMILTON
How long have you known?
ELIZA
A month or so.
HAMILTON
Eliza, you should have told me.
ELIZA
I wrote to the General a month ago.
HAMILTON
No.
ELIZA
I begged him to send you home.
HAMILTON
You should have told me.
ELIZA
I’m not sorry.
 ELIZA HAMILTON
I knew you’d fight until the war was won
The war’s not done.
But you deserve a chance to meet your son. Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.
HAMILTON
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife, unable to provide for your life?
ELIZA
I relish being your wife. Look around, look around…
Look at where you are. Look at where you started. The fact that you’re alive is a miracle. Just stay alive, that would be enough.
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile or a fragment of your mind, look out world! That would be enough.
I don’t pretend to know the challenges you’re facing. The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind.
But I’m not afraid. I know who I married. So long as you come home at the end of the day that would be enough.
We don’t need a legacy. We don’t need money. If I could grant you peace of mind,
If you could let me inside your heart... Oh, let me be a part of the narrative in the story they will write someday. Let this moment be the first chapter: where you decide to stay and I could be enough and we could be enough that would be enough.
18. GUNS AND SHIPS
BURR
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower somehow defeat a global superpower? How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire? Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher? Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon! An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in! He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen. Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!
COMPANY
Lafayette!
LAFAYETTE
I’m takin this horse by the reins makin’ redcoats redder with bloodstains.
COMPANY
Lafayette!
LAFAYETTE
And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I’m-

COMPANY
Lafayette!
LAFAYETTE
Watch me engagin’ em! Escapin’ em! Enragin’ em! I’m-
COMPANY
Lafayette!
LAFAYETTE
I go to France for more funds.
COMPANY
Lafayette!
LAFAYETTE
I come back with more
LAFAYETTE AND ENSEMBLE
Guns And ships And so the balance shifts.
WASHINGTON
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts.
LAFAYETTE
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but for this to succeed, there’s someone else we need:
WASHINGTON
I know.
WASHINGTON AND COMPANY

I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. This is where it gets me: on my feet, the enemy ahead of me. If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me, weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me. Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me... not only that, my Eliza’s expecting.
We gotta go, gotta get the job done, gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son! Take the bullets out your gun!
ENSEMBLE
What?
HAMILTON
The bullets out your gun!
ENSEMBLE
What?
HAMILTON
We move under cover and we move as one through the night, we have one shot to live another day. We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away. We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it. It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet. The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

Rochambeau!

You have your orders now, go, man, go! And so the American experiment begins with my friends all scattered to the winds. Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry.

Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom.
WASHINGTON
Not. Yet.

We negotiate the terms of surrender. I see George Washington smile. We escort their men out of Yorktown. They stagger home single file. Tens of thousands of people flood the streets. There are screams and church bells ringing.

What comes next? You’ve been freed. Do you know how hard it is to lead?
You’re on your own. Awesome. Wow. Do you have a clue what happens now?

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one.

1789. How does the bastard orphan, immigrant decorated war vet unite the colonies through more debt? Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit? Have it all, lose it all, you ready for more yet? Treasury Secretary. Washington’s the President, ev’ry American experiment sets a precedent. Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him. Pissed him off until we had a two-party system. You haven’t met him yet, you haven’t had the chance, ‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to France but someone’s gotta keep the American promise. You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

I helped Lafayette draft a declaration, then I said, ‘I gotta go. I gotta be in Monticello.’ Now the work at home begins…

Aaa-ooo!

So what’d I miss? What’d I miss? Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss. I’ve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies... I guess I basic’lly missed the late eighties... I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this…
ENSEMBLE
Aaa-ooo!
JEFFERSON
There’s a letter on my desk from the President. Haven’t even put my bags down yet. Sally be a lamb, darlin’, won’tcha open it? It says the President’s assembling a cabinet and that I am to be the Secretary of State, great! And that I’m already Senate-approved... I just got home and now I’m headed up to New York.

But who’s waitin’ for me when I step in the place? My friend James Madison, red in the face.
JEFFERSON
He grabs my arm and I respond, ENSEMBLE
“What’s goin’ on?” Aaa-ooo!
MADISON
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation’s very soul. Can you get us out of the mess we’re in?

I guess I better think of something to say,
I’m already on my way, On my way let’s get to the bottom of this… What did I miss?

Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton.

2. CABINET BATTLE #1
WASHINGTON
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you’re here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???
WASHINGTON
The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor.
JEFFERSON
‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.’ We fought for these ideals; we shouldn’t settle for less.
These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em. Don’t act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em.
JEFFERSON/MADISON
Oww
JEFFERSON
But Hamilton forgets his plan would have the government assume state’s debts. Now, place your bets as to who that benefits: the very seat of government where Hamilton sits.
HAMILTON
Not true!
JEFFERSON
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it. If New York’s in debt— why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I’m afraid. Don’t tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade. In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground. We create. You just wanna move our money around. This financial plan is an outrageous demand, and it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand. Stand with me in the land of the free and pray to God we never see Hamilton’s candidacy. Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky. Imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky.
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response.
HAMILTON
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration. Welcome to the present, we’re running a real nation. Would you like to join us, or stay mellow,
Doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello? If we assume the debts, the union gets A new line of credit, a financial diuretic. How do you not get it? If we’re aggressive and competitive The union gets a boost. You’d rather give it a sedative? A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor, Your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor. “We plant seeds in the South. We create.” Yeah, keep ranting, we know who’s really doing the planting. And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment, Don’t lecture me about the war, you didn’t fight in it. You think I’m frightened of you, man? We almost died in a trench while you were off getting high with the French. Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President, reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison. Madison, you’re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine. Damn, you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in, sittin’ there useless as two shits. Hey, turn around, bend over, I’ll show you where my shoe fits.
WASHINGTON
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk!  We’ll reconvene after   a brief recess. Hamilton!
HAMILTON
Sir!
WASHINGTON
A word.
MADISON
You don’t have the votes.

JEFFERSON/MADISON
You don’t have the votes.
JEFFERSON
Aha-ha-ha ha!
JEFFERSON/MADISON
You’re gonna need congressional approval and you don’t have the votes.
JEFFERSON
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder.
MADISON
Why he even brings the thunder…
WASHINGTON
You wanna pull yourself together?
HAMILTON
I’m sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather.
WASHINGTON
Young man, I’m from Virginia, so watch your mouth.
HAMILTON
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?
WASHINGTON
You need the votes.
HAMILTON
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan.
WASHINGTON
No, you need to convince more folks.
HAMILTON
James Madison won’t talk to me, that’s a nonstarter.
WASHINGTON
Winning was easy, young man. Governing’s harder.
HAMILTON
They’re being intransigent.
WASHINGTON
You have to find a compromise.

But they don’t have a plan, they just hate mine!

Convince them otherwise.

There’s nothing like summer in the city. Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty. There’s trouble in the air, you can smell it. and Alexander’s by himself.  I’ll let him tell it.
HAMILTON
I hadn’t slept in a week. I was weak, I was awake. You never seen a bastard orphan more in need of a break. Longing for Angelica. Missing my wife. That’s when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:
MARIA REYNOLDS
I know you are a man of honor, I’m so sorry to bother you at home but I don’t know where to go, and I came here all alone...
HAMILTON
She said:
MARIA
My husband’s doin’ me wrong beatin’ me, cheatin’ me, mistreatin’ me... Suddenly he’s up and gone. I don’t have the means to go on.
HAMILTON
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said
MARIA
You’re too kind, sir.
HAMILTON
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away, she lived a block away, she said:
MARIA
This one’s mine, sir.
HAMILTON
Then I said, “well, I should head back home,” she turned red, she led me to her bed, let her legs spread and said:
MARIA
Stay?
HAMILTON
Hey...
MARIA
Hey...
HAMILTON
That’s when I began to pray: Lord, show me how to say no to this. I don’t know how to say no to this.
HAMILTON
But my God, she looks so helpless And her body’s saying, “hell, yes”
MARIA
Whoa…
HAMILTON
Nooo, show me how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this.

HAMILTON
I don’t know how to
HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE
Say no to this.
HAMILTON
In my mind, I’m tryin’ to go
ENSEMBLE
Go! Go! Go!
HAMILTON
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don’t say...
ENSEMBLE
No! No! Say no to this!
No! No! Say no to this!
No! No! Say no to this!
No! No! Say no to this!
HAMILTON
I wish I could say that was the last time. I said that last time. It became a pastime. A month into this endeavor I received a letter from a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:
JAMES REYNOLDS
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health, and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth in the pockets of people like me: down on their luck. You see, that was my wife who you decided to
HAMILTON
Fuuuu—
JAMES REYNOLDS
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold, so time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled. And hey, you can keep seein’ my whore wife if the price is right: if not I’m telling your wife.
HAMILTON
I hid the letter and I raced to her place, screamed “How could you?!” in her face, she said:
MARIA
No, sir!
HAMILTON
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked pathetic, she cried:
MARIA
Please don’t go, sir!
HAMILTON
So was your whole story a setup?
MARIA
I don’t know about any letter!
HAMILTON
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!
MARIA
I didn’t know any better
HAMILTON
I am ruined...
MARIA HAMILTON
Please don’t leave me with him helpless.
I am helpless—how could I do this?
Just give him what he wants and you can have me. I don’t want you
Whatever you want,
I don’t want you
MARIA HAMILTON
If you pay, I don’t…
You can stay. Lord, show
me how to ENSEMBLE
say no to this. Say no to this!
Tonight
I don’t know how to say no to this. Say no to this!
Cuz the situation’s helpless.
Helpless.
And her body’s screaming, “Hell, yes”
Whoa!
No, show me how to say no to this. Say no to this!
How can I
How can you say no to this?
Say no to this? Say no to this!
There is nowhere I can go. When her body’s on mine Go! Go! Go! I do not say... No! No!
HAMILTON ENSEMBLE
Yes. MARIA Say no to this! Yes!
Yes.
No! No!
Yes!

Say no to this! Yes. Yes! No! No!
Say no to this! Yes. Yes! No! No!
Say no to this!
HAMILTON
Say no to this. MARIA
I don’t say no to this,  Don’t say no to this.
there is nowhere I can go. ENSEMBLE
Go go go…
JAMES REYNOLDS
So?
HAMILTON
Nobody needs to know.
5. THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS
BURR
Ah, Mister Secretary.
HAMILTON
Mister Burr, sir.
BURR
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?
HAMILTON
No.
BURR
You know Clermont Street?
HAMILTON
Yeah.
BURR
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure.
HAMILTON
Sure.
BURR
And all he had to do was die.
HAMILTON
That’s a lot less work.
BURR
We oughta give it a try.
HAMILTON
Ha.
BURR
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?
HAMILTON
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you.
BURR
Really?
HAMILTON
Talk less. Smile more.
BURR
Ha.
HAMILTON
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor.
BURR
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.
HAMILTON
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner.
MADISON
Hamilton!
HAMILTON
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go.
BURR
But—
HAMILTON
Decisions are happening over dinner.
BURR
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room.
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Diametric’ly opposed, foes.
BURR
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Previously closed,
ENSEMBLE
Bros.
BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power, a system he can shape however he wants. The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital. And here’s the pièce de résistance:
BURR
No one else was in the room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one else was in ENSEMBLE
the room where it happened.
The room where it happened.

The room where it happened. The room where it happened.

No one really knows how the game is played. The game is played. The art of the trade, how the sausage gets made.
How the sausage gets made.
We just assume that it happens.

But no one else is in the room where it happens.
The room where it happens.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day in distress ‘n disarray.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Alexander said—
HAMILTON
I’ve nowhere else to turn!
JEFFERSON
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray.
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
I approached Madison and said– “I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”
BURR AND COMPANY
Thomas claims—
JEFFERSON
Well, I arranged the meeting. I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating,
BURR
But! No one else was in-
 BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened.
BURR
No one else was in-
BURR AND COMPANY

BURR
No one really knows how the COMPANY

Ev’ry game of chesssss.
We just assume that it happens.

But no one else is in the room where it happens.
The room where it happens.
BURR AND COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee.
COMPANY
Meanwhile—
BURR
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—
Company screams in chaos.
BURR
It isn’t pretty. Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite, And Madison responds with Virginian insight:
MADISON
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—
JEFFERSON
Oh-ho!
MADISON
A quid pro quo.
JEFFERSON
I suppose.
MADISON
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?
JEFFERSON
Actually, I would.
MADISON
Well, I propose the Potomac.
JEFFERSON
And you’ll provide him his votes?
MADISON
Well, we’ll see how it goes.
JEFFERSON
Let’s go.
BURR
No!

COMPANY
–one else was in the room where it happened.
BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one else was in the room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened.
BURR
My God!
BURR AND COMPANY
In God we trust. But we’ll never really know what got discussed. Click-boom then it happened.
BURR
And no one else was in the room where it happened.
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Did Washington know about the dinner? Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?
COMPANY
Alexander Hamilton!
BURR
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter where you put the U.S. Capital?
HAMILTON
Cuz we’ll have the banks,
we’re in the same spot.
BURR
You got more than you gave.
HAMILTON
And I wanted what I got.
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game. But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game. Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it. You get nothing if you...
HAMILTON AND COMPANY
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!
HAMILTON
God help and forgive me, I wanna build something that’s gonna outlive me.
HAMILTON/ JEFFERSON/ MADISON/ WASHINGTON COMPANY
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?
If you stand for nothing,
What do you want, Burr?

6. SCHUYLER DEFEATED
PHILIP
Look! Grampa’s in the paper! ‘War Hero Philip Schuyler loses Senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr!’ Grampa just lost his seat in the Senate.
ELIZA
Sometimes that’s how it goes.
PHILIP
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute.
ELIZA
I’m sure he already knows.
PHILIP
Further down,
PHILIP AND ELIZA
Further down,
PHILIP
“Let’s meet the newest Senator from New York…”
ELIZA
New York—
PHILIP AND ELIZA
Our Senator!...
HAMILTON
Burr!
HAMILTON
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
BURR
Since being one put me on the up and up again.
HAMILTON
No one knows who you are or what you do.
BURR
They don’t need to know me. They don’t like you.
HAMILTON
Excuse me?
BURR
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great. You’ll always be adored by the things you create. But upstate,
HAMILTON
Wait.
BURR
People think you’re crooked! And Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs, so I took it.
HAMILTON
I’ve always considered you a friend.
BURR
I don’t see why that has to end!
HAMILTON
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law.
BURR
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw. I swear, your pride will be the death of us all! Beware: it goeth before the fall…
7. CABINET BATTLE #2
WASHINGTON
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England. Do we provide aid and troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it? Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval. The only person you have to convince is me. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir.
JEFFERSON
When we were on death’s door, when we were needy, we made a promise, we signed a treaty. We needed money and guns and half a chance. Who provided those funds?
MADISON
France.

JEFFERSON
In return, they didn’t ask for land, only a promise that we’d lend a hand and stand with them if they fought against oppressors, and revolution is messy but now is the time to stand. Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny. I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he would rather not have this debate. I’ll remind you that he is not Secretary of State. He knows nothing of loyalty, smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty, desperate to rise above his station, everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation.
ENSEMBLE
Ooh!!
JEFFERSON
Hey, and if ya don’t know, now ya know, Mr. President.
WASHINGTON
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response.
HAMILTON
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think the President is gonna bring the nation to the brink of meddling in the middle of a military mess, a game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless. We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket. Would you like to take it out and ask it? “Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?” “Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead .”
WASHINGTON
Enough. Hamilton is right.
JEFFERSON
Mr. President—
WASHINGTON
We’re too fragile to start another fight.
JEFFERSON
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?
WASHINGTON
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em.
JEFFERSON
The people are leading—
WASHINGTON
The people are rioting. There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality. Hamilton.
HAMILTON
Sir.
WASHINGTON
Draft a statement of neutrality.
JEFFERSON
Did you forget Lafayette?
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
Have you an ounce of regret? You accumulate debt, you accumulate power, yet in their hour of need, you forget.
HAMILTON
Lafayette’s a smart man, he’ll be fine. And before he was your friend, he was mine. If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop.
Where do we draw the line?
JEFFERSON
So quick-witted.
HAMILTON
Alas, I admit it.
JEFFERSON
I bet you were quite a lawyer.
HAMILTON
My defendants got acquitted.
JEFFERSON
Huh. Well, someone oughta remind you.
HAMILTON
What?
JEFFERSON
You’re nothing without Washington behind you.
WASHINGTON
Hamilton!
JEFFERSON
Daddy’s calling.
8. WASHINGTON ON YOUR SIDE
BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.
JEFFERSON
Ev’ry action has its equal, opposite reactions. Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured into factions. Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions.

We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions. I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion. The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion. Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration as Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in. This prick is askin’ for someone to bring him to task. Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him. I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it. While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket.
JEFFERSON AND BURR
It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.
Look back at the Bill of Rights.
MADISON
Which I wrote.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
The ink hasn’t dried. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.
MADISON
So he’s doubled the size of the government. Wasn’t the trouble with much our previous government size?
BURR
Look in his eyes!
JEFFERSON
See how he lies.
MADISON
Follow the scent of his enterprise.
JEFFERSON
Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive.
MADISON
If we don’t stop it we aid and abet it.
JEFFERSON
I have to resign.
MADISON
Somebody has to stand up for the South!
BURR
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!
JEFFERSON
If there’s a fire you’re trying to douse,
MADISON AND JEFFERSON
You can’t put it out from inside the house.
JEFFERSON
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it. If Washington isn’t gon’ listen to disciplined dissidents, this is the difference: This kid is out!
MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON
Oh! This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose. Oh! This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes. Oh! Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up against! Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON
Southern motherfuckin’-
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Democratic-Republicans!
JEFF/MAD/BURR/ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes.
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Because every second the Treasury grows.
ENSEMBLE
Oh!
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
If we follow the money and see where it leads, get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamilton’s misdeeds.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice.
MADISON
Follow the money and see where it goes.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
It must be nice. It must be nice.
JEFFERSON
The emperor has no clothes.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
We won’t be invisible.  We won’t be denied. Still, it must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.
9. ONE LAST TIME
HAMILTON
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

WASHINGTON
I know you’re busy.
HAMILTON
What do you need, sir? Sir?
WASHINGTON
I wanna give you a word of warning.
HAMILTON
Sir, I don’t know what you heard, But whatever it is, Jefferson started it.
WASHINGTON
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning.
HAMILTON
You’re kidding.
WASHINGTON
I need a favor.
HAMILTON
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior.
WASHINGTON
Shh. Talk less.
HAMILTON
I’ll use the press, I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—
WASHINGTON
I need you to draft an address.
HAMILTON
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—
WASHINGTON
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President.
HAMILTON
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir.
WASHINGTON
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President.
HAMILTON
I’m sorry, what?
WASHINGTON
One last time. Relax, have a drink with me one last time. Let’s take a break tonight and then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye, to say goodbye. You and I.
HAMILTON
No, sir, why?
WASHINGTON
I wanna talk about neutrality.
HAMILTON
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—
WASHINGTON
I want to warn against partisan fighting.
HAMILTON
But—
WASHINGTON
Pick up a pen, start writing. I wanna talk about what I have learned. The hard-won wisdom I have earned.
HAMILTON
As far as the people are concerned, you have to serve, you could continue to serve—
WASHINGTON
No! One last time the people will hear from me one last time and if we get this right
we’re gonna teach ‘em how to say goodbye. You and I—
HAMILTON
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak.
WASHINGTON
No, they will see we’re strong.
HAMILTON
Your position is so unique.
WASHINGTON
So I’ll use it to move them along.
HAMILTON
Why do you have to say goodbye?
WASHINGTON
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on. It outlives me when I’m gone. Like the scripture says: “Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid.” They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made. I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree. A moment alone in the shade, at home in this nation we’ve made. One last time.
HAMILTON
One last time.
HAMILTON
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me
HAMILTON WASHINGTON

10. I KNOW HIM
KING GEORGE
They say George Washington’s yielding his power and stepping away. ‘Zat true? I wasn’t aware that was something a person could do. I’m perplexed. Are they gonna keep on replacing whoever’s in charge? If so, who’s next? There’s nobody else in their country who looms quite as large . . .
A sentinel whispers in King George’s ear.
John Adams?! I know him. That can’t be. That’s that little guy who spoke to me all those years ago. What was it, eighty-five? That poor man, they’re gonna eat him alive! Oceans rise. Empires fall. Next to Washington, they all look small. All alone, watch them run. They will tear each other into pieces, Jesus Christ, this will be fun!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da Da da da dat dat da ya daaaaa!
“President John Adams” Good Luck.
11. THE ADAMS ADMINISTRATION
BURR
How does Hamilton, the short-tempered, protean creator of the Coast Guard, Founder of the New York Post, ardently abuse his cab’net post, destroy his reputation? Welcome, folks, to
BURR/COMPANY
The Adams administration!
BURR
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President.
JEFFERSON
Washington can’t help you now, no more mister nice President.

BURR
Adams fires Hamilton. Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his taunts.
JEFFERSON
Say what?!
BURR
Hamilton publishes his response.
HAMILTON
Sit down, John, you fat motherf-
BURR
Hamilton is out of control.
MADISON
This is great!  He’s out of power.  He holds no office.  And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party.
JEFFERSON
Hamilton’s a host unto himself.  As long as he can hold a pen, he’s a threat.  Let’s let him know what we know.
12. WE KNOW
HAMILTON
Mr. Vice President. Mr. Madison. Senator Burr. What is this?
JEFFERSON
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts...
MADISON
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts...
BURR
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in seventeen ninety-one.
HAMILTON
Is that what you have? Are you done?
MADISON
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position—
JEFFERSON
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation—
MADISON
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission—
JEFFERSON
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation—
BURR
An immigrant embezzling our government funds—
JEFFERSON/MADISON
I can almost see the headline, your career is done.
BURR
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons .
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON
Ya best g’wan run back where ya come from.
HAMILTON
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Confess.
HAMILTON
You got nothing. I don’t have to tell you anything at all.
Unless.
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Unless?
HAMILTON
If I can prove that I never broke the law, do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?
BURR
No one else was in the room where it happened.
HAMILTON
Is that a yes?
JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR
Um, yes.
BURR
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth in the pockets of people like me: down on their luck. You see, it was my wife who you decided to –”
JEFFERSON
Whaaaat –
HAMILTON
She courted me. Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner that’s when Reynolds extorted me for a sordid fee. I paid him quarterly. I may have mortally wounded my prospects but my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered History. Check it again against your list n’ see consistency. I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine,

you sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine. Yes, I have reasons for shame but I have not committed treason and sullied my good name. As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action. Are my answers to your satisfaction?
JEFFERSON
My God.
MADISON
Gentlemen, let’s go.
HAMILTON
So?
JEFFERSON AND MADISON
The people won’t know what we know.
HAMILTON
Burr! How do I know you won’t use this against me the next time we go toe to toe?
BURR
Alexander, rumors only grow.  And we both know what we know.
13. HURRICANE
HAMILTON
In the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment, a yellow sky.
When I was seventeen a hurricane destroyed my town. I didn’t drown. I couldn’t seem to die.
I wrote my way out, wrote everything down far as I could see. I wrote my way out. I looked up and the town had its eyes on me.
They passed a plate around. Total strangers moved to kindness by my story. Raised enough for me to book passage on a ship that was New York bound… I wrote my way out of hell.   I wrote my way to revolution. I was louder than the crack in the bell. I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell. I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well. And in the face of ignorance and resistance, I wrote financial systems into existence. And when my prayers to God were met with indifference, I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance.
In the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment, a yellow sky.
I was twelve when my mother died. She was holding me. We were sick and she was holding me. I couldn’t seem to die.
BURR
Wait for it, wait for it, HAMILTON
wait for it... I’ll write my way out...
BURR AND ENSEMBLE
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...
Write ev’rything down, far as I can see... I’ll write my way out...
WASH/ELI/ ANG/MAR
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait...
Overwhelm them with honesty.
History has its eyes on you.
HAMILTON
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only way I can protect my legacy...
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait...

Have you read this?
BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair. And he wrote it down right there.
MADISON
Highlights!

15. BURN
ELIZA
I saved every letter you wrote me. From the moment I read them I knew you were mine. You said you were mine. I thought you were mine.
Do you know what Angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive? She said,
“Be careful with that one, love. He will do what it takes to survive.”
You and your words flooded my senses. Your sentences left me defenseless. You built me palaces out of paragraphs, you built cathedrals. I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me. I’m searching and scanning for answers in every line, for some kind of sign, and when you were mine the world seemed to
Burn. Burn.
You published the letters she wrote you. You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed. In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives. Do you know what Angelica said When she read what you’d done? She said, “You have married an Icarus. He has flown too close to the sun.”
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy... Your sentences border on senseless, and you are paranoid in every paragraph how they perceive you,
You, you, you...
I’m erasing myself from the narrative. Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart. You have torn it all apart. I am watching it burn. Watching it burn. The world has no right to my heart. The world has no place in our bed. They don’t get to know what I said. I’m burning the memories, Burning the letters that might have redeemed you. You forfeit all rights to my heart. You forfeit the place in our bed. You sleep in your office instead, with only the memories of when you were mine. I hope that you burn.
16. BLOW US ALL AWAY
PHILIP
Meet the latest graduate of King’s College! I prob’ly shouldn’t brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish! The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops! The ladies say my brain’s not where the resemblance stops! I’m only nineteen but my mind is older, gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder. I shoulder his legacy with pride, I used to hear him say that someday  I would—
ENSEMBLE
Blow us all away.
PHILIP
Ladies, I’m lookin for a Mr. George Eacker. Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker. He disparaged my father’s legacy in front of a crowd. I can’t have that, I’m making my father proud.
MARTHA
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks. He was goin’ to see a play.
PHILIP
Well, I’ll go visit his box.
DOLLY
God, you’re a fox.
PHILIP
And y’all look pretty good in ya’ frocks. How ‘bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

Ok!

PHILIP

GEORGE
Shh! I’m tryin’ to watch the show!
PHILIP
Ya’ shoulda watched your mouth before you talked about my father though!

GEORGE
I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true. You father’s a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you.
ENSEMBLE
Ooooooooooh!
PHILIP
It’s like that?
GEORGE
Yeah, I don’t fool around. I’m not your little schoolboy friends.
PHILIP
See you on the dueling ground. That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now.
GEORGE
I know where to find you, piss off. I’m watchin’ this show now.
 PHILIP
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to—
HAMILTON
Slow down.
PHILIP
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel. They don’t exactly cover this subject in boarding school.
HAMILTON
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?
PHILIP
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease.
HAMILTON
Where is this happening?
PHILIP
Across the river, in Jersey.
HAMILTON/PHILIP
Everything is legal in New Jersey...
HAMILTON
Alright. So this is what you’re gonna do: Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you. When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air. This will put an end to the whole affair.
PHILIP
But what if he decides to shoot? Then I’m a goner.
HAMILTON
No. He’ll follow suit if he’s truly a man of honor. To take someone’s life, that is something you can’t shake. Philip, your mother can’t take another heartbreak.
PHILIP
Father—
HAMILTON
Promise me. You don’t want this young man’s blood on your conscience.
PHILIP
Okay, I promise.
HAMILTON
Come back home when you’re done. Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son.
PHILIP
My name is Philip I am a poet I’m a little nervous, but I can’t show it. I’m sorry, I’m a Hamilton with pride.
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide.
PHILIP
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?
GEORGE
I’d rather skip the pleasantries. Let’s go. Grab your pistol.
PHILIP
Confer with your men. The duel will commence after we count to ten.

18. IT’S QUIET UPTOWN
ANGELICA
There are moments that the words don’t reach. There is suffering too terrible to name. You hold your child as tight as you can and push away the unimaginable. The moments when you’re in so deep, it feels easier to just swim down.
ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE
The Hamiltons move uptown and learn to live with the unimaginable.
HAMILTON
I spend hours in the garden. I walk alone to the store, and it’s quiet uptown. I never liked the quiet before. I take the children to church on Sunday, a sign of the cross at the door, and I pray. That never used to happen before.
ANGELICA AND WOMEN
If you see him in the street, walking by himself, talking to himself, have pity.
HAMILTON
Philip, you would like it uptown. It’s quiet uptown.
ANGELICA AND WOMEN
He is working through the unimaginable.

You knock me out, I fall apart.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)
Can you imagine?
HAMILTON
Look at where we are. Look at where we started. I know I don’t deserve you, Eliza. But hear me out. That would be enough.
If I could spare his life, If I could trade his life for mine, he’d be standing here right now and you would smile, and that would be enough. I don’t pretend to know the challenges we’re facing. I know there’s no replacing what we’ve lost and you need time. But I’m not afraid, I know who I married. Just let me stay here by your side, That would be enough.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)
If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking by her side, have pity.

Eliza, do you like it uptown? It’s quiet uptown.

HAMILTON
Look around, look around, Eliza.
COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND ELIZA)

ANGELICA
There are moments that the words don’t reach. There is a grace too powerful to name. We push away what we can never understand, we push away the unimaginable.

It’s quiet uptown.

JEFFERSON
With his own faction.
MADISON
He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances.

He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances.

And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!
MADISON
Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you.
JEFFERSON

20. YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT
BURR
How does Hamilton, an arrogant, immigrant, orphan, bastard, whoreson, somehow endorse Thomas Jefferson, his enemy, a man he’s despised since the beginning, just to keep me from winning? I wanna be in the room where it happens —

BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happens. The room where it happens.
BURR
You’ve kept me from—
 BURR AND COMPANY
The room where it happens.
BURR
For the last time. Dear Alexander:
I am slow to anger, but I toe the line as I reckon with the effects of your life on mine. I look back on where I failed, and in every place I checked, the only common thread has been your disrespect. Now you call me “amoral,” a “dangerous disgrace,” if you’ve got something to say, name a time and place, face to face.
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Burr.
HAMILTON
Mr. Vice President, I am not the reason no one trusts you. No one knows what you believe. I will not equivocate on my opinion, I have always worn it on my sleeve. Even if I said what you think I said, you would need to cite a more specific grievance. Here’s an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements.
BURR
Sweet Jesus.
HAMILTON
Hey, I have not been shy. I am just a guy in the public eye Tryin’ to do my best for our republic. I don’t wanna fight, But I won’t apologize for doing what’s right.
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Ham.
BURR
Careful how you proceed, good man. Intemperate indeed, good man. Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or prepare to bleed, good man.
HAMILTON
Burr, your grievance is legitimate. I stand by what I said, every bit of it. You stand only for yourself. It’s what you do. I can’t apologize because it’s true.
BURR
Then stand, Alexander. Weehawken. Dawn. Guns. Drawn.
HAMILTON
You’re on.
BURR AND HAMILTON
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant,
HAMILTON
A dot Ham.
BURR

FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND BURR)

There are ten things you need to know.

Number one!

We rowed across the Hudson at dawn. My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my—
BURR AND COMPANY
Number two!
BURR
Hamilton arrived with his crew: Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew.
COMPANY
Number three!
BURR
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain. I wish I could tell you what was happ’ning in his brain. This man has poisoned my political pursuits!
COMPANY
Most disputes die and no one shoots! Number four!
BURR
Hamilton drew first position. Looking,to the world, like a man on a mission. This is a soldier with a marksman’s ability. The doctor turned around so he could have deniability.
COMPANY
Five!
BURR
Now I didn’t know this at the time But we were—
BURR AND PHILIP HAMILTON
Near the same spot your son died, is that why—
Near the same spot my son died, is that why—
COMPANY
Six!

He examined his gun with such rigor? I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger.
COMPANY
Seven!
BURR
Confession time? Here’s what I got: My fellow soldiers’ll tell you I’m a terrible shot.
COMPANY
Number eight!
BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN
Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight.
BURR
They won’t teach you this in your classes, but look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses. Why? If not to take deadly aim? It’s him or me, the world will never be the same. I had only one thought before the slaughter: This man will not make an orphan of my daughter.
COMPANY
Number nine!
BURR
Look him in the eye, aim no higher. Summon all the courage you require. Then count:
COMPANY
One two three four five six seven eight nine Number ten paces! Fire!—
HAMILTON
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev’ral feet ahead of me? I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be? There is no beat, no melody. Burr, my first friend, my enemy, maybe the last face I ever see, If I throw away my shot, is this how you remember me? What if this bullet is my legacy?
Legacy. What is a legacy? It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me. America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me. You let me make a difference. A place where even orphan immigrants can leave their fingerprints and rise up. I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up. Wise up. Eyes up. I catch a glimpse of the other side. Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side. My son is on the other side. He’s with my mother on the other side. Washington is watching from the other side.
Teach me how to say goodbye.
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Eliza,
My love, take your time. I’ll see you on the other side. Raise a glass to freedom…
 BURR AND COMPANY
He aims his pistol at the sky—

BURR
Wait!
BURR
I strike him right between his ribs. I walk towards him, but I am ushered away. They row him back across the Hudson. I get a drink.

Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.”

BURR AND ANGELICA
Angelica and Eliza—
BURR
Were both at his side when he died. Death doesn’t discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes. History obliterates. In every picture it paints, it paints me with all my mistakes. When Alexander aimed at the sky, he may have been the first one to die,
but I’m the one who paid for it. I survived, but I paid for it. Now I’m the villain in your history.
I was too young and blind to see... I should’ve known. I should’ve known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me. The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me.
