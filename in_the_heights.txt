Lights up on Washington Heights, up at the break of day
I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away
Pop the grate at the crack of dawn, sing
While I wipe down the awning
Hey ya'll good morning

PIRAGUA GUY
Ice cold piragua! Parcha. China. Cherry. Strawberry. Just for today, I got mamey!

USNAVI
Yo, piraguero, como estas?

PIRAGUA GUY
Como siempre, Senor Usnavi.

USNAVI
I am Usnavi and you prob'ly never heard my name
Reports of my fame
Are greatly exaggerated
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax
Is highly complicated cuz I emigrated from the single greatest little place in the Caribbean
Dominican Republic
I love it,
Jesus, I'm jealous of it
And beyond that,
Ever since my folks passed on,
I haven't gone back
Goddamn, I gotta get on that
(He sniffs the milk carton) Oh!
The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?
I better step it up and fight the heat
Cuz I'm not making any profit if the coffee isn't light and sweet!

ABUELA CLAUDIA
Ooo-ooo!

USNAVI
Abuela, my fridge broke. I've got cafe, but no con leche.

ABUELA CLAUDIA
Try my mother's old recipe: one can of condensed milk.

USNAVI
Nice.

ABUELA CLAUDIA
Ay! Paciencia y fe!

USNAVI
That was Abuela, she's not really my abuela
But she practically raised me
This corner is her escuela
Now you're prob'ly thinkin
"I'm up on shit's creek
I never been north of 96th street"
Well you must take the A train
Even farther than Harlem
To norther Manhattan and maintain
Get off at 181st and take the escalator
I hope your writing this down I'm gonna test you later
I'm getting tested times are tough on this bodega
Two months ago somebody bought Ortega's
Our neighborhood started packin up and pickin up
And ever since the rents went up
It's gotten mad expensive
But we live with just enough

COMMUNITY
In the heights
I flip my lights and start my day
There are fights
(Girls) And endless debts
(Boys) And bills to pay
In the heights
I can't survive without cafe

USNAVI
I serve cafe

COMMUNITY
Cuz tonight seems like a million years away!
En Washington-

USNAVI
Next up to bat, the Rosarios
They run the cab company
They struggle in the barrio
See, their daughter Nina's off at college, tuition is mad steep
So they can't sleep
Everything they get is mad cheap

KEVIN
Good morning, Usnavi.

USNAVI
Pan caliente, cafe con leche

KEVIN
Put twenty dollars on today's lottery

CAMILA
One ticket, that's it

KEVIN
Hey, a man's gotta dream

CAMILA
Don't mind him, he's all excited
Cuz Nina just flew in at 3 AM last night

KEVIN
Don't look at me, this one's been cooking all week.

CAMILA
Usnavi, come over for dinner

KEVIN/CAMILA
There's plenty to eat

DANIELA
So then Yesenia walk in the room
She smells sex and cheap perfume
It smells like one of those trees that you hang from the rear view
It's true
She screams, "Who's in there with you, Julio?"
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door
He's in bed with Jose from the liquor store

CARLA/USNAVI
No me diga

USNAVI
Daniela and Carla from the salon.

DANIELA/CARLA
Thanks, Usnavi!

USNAVI
Sonny, you're late.

SONNY
Chillax, you know you love me.

USNAVI
Me and my cousin runnin just another dime a dozen
Mom-and-pop stop-and-shop
And, oh my God, it's gotten too darn hot like my man Cole Porter said
People come through for a few cold waters and a lottery ticket, just a part of the routine
Everybody's got a job
Everybody's got a dream
They gossip as I sip my coffee and smirk
The first stop as people hop to work
Bust it-I'm like-
1 dollar, 2 dollar, 1.50, 1.69
I got it
You want a box of condoms what kind?
That's two quarters
Two quarter waters. The New York Times
You need a bag for that? The tax is added
Once you get some practice at it
You do rapid mathematics
Automatically
Sellin maxipads and fuzzy dice for taxicabs and practically
Everybody's stressed, yes, but they press through the mess
Bounce checks and wonder what's next

COMMUNITY
In the heights
I buy my coffee and I go
Set my sights
On only what I need to know
In the heights
Money is tight

When the lights go down I blast my radio

It's not reflected in my bank statement
But I've been savin to make a down payment and pay rent
No, no, I won't let you down

BENNY
(to Usnavi) Yo, here's your chance ask her out right now.

USNAVI
No way

VANESSA
I'll see you later, so...(she exits)

BENNY
Ooh, smooth operator, aw damn there she go!
Yo, bro, take 5, take a walk outside
You look exhausted, lost, don't let life slide!
The whole hood is struggling, times are tight,
And you're stuck to this corner like a streetlight (exits)

USNAVI
Yeah, I'm a streetlight
Choking on the heat
The world spins around
While I'm frozen to my seat
The people that I know
All keep rolling down the street
But every day is different
So I'm switchin up the beat
Cuz my parents came with nothing
They got a little more
And sure, we're poor, but yo,
At least we got the store
And it's all about the legacy
They left with me, it's destiny
And one day I'll be on a beach
With Sonny writing checks to me

Yo! I know just where to go
There's a little beach named Playa Rincon
With no roads, you need a rowboat or motorbike
To reach this beach and it's a stone's throw from home
My folks' home
Before I was born
Before they passed on

They would talk about home I listened closely for the way they whispered to each other
'Bout the warmer winter weather
Inseparable, they even got sick together
But they never got better
Passed away that December
And left me with these memories like dyin embers
From a dream I can't remember
Ever since then it's like another day deeper in debt
With different dilemmas,
The bodega's a mess
I'll be seeing less of Vanessa
Abuela, I don't know how I can keep it together

ABUELA CLAUDIA
Remember the story of your name
It was engraved on a passing ship on the day your family came
You father said "Usnavi"
That's what we'll name the baby

It really said "US Navy," but hey
I worked with what they gave me okay

Please drive slow
Let everybody know
Abeula Claudia passed away
At noon today</p>
<p id="songLyricsDiv" class="songLyricsV14 iComment-text">USNAVI
She was found and pronounced at the scene
She was already lying in bed
The paramedics said
That her heart gave out
I mean, that's basically what they said
They said a combination of the stress and the heat
Why she never took her medicine, I'll never understand
I'd like to think she went out in peace
With pieces of bread crumbs in her hand
Abuela Claudia had simple pleasures
She sang the praises of things we ignore
Glass Coke bottles, bread crumbs, a sky full of stars
She cherished these things
She'd say "Alabanza"
Alabanza means to raise this thing to God's face and to sing
Quite literally "praise to this"
When she was here, the path was clear
And she was just here
She was just here...

In this album, there's a picture
Of the ladies at Daniela's
You can tell it's from the 80s by the volume of their hair
There's Usnavi, just a baby
'87, Halloween
If it happened on this block
Abuela was there
Every afternoon I came
She'd make sure I did my homework
She could barely write her name
But even so
She would stare at the paper and tell me,
"Bueno,
Let's review.
Why don't you tell me everything you know?"
In this album there's a picture
Of Abuela in Havana
She is holding a rag doll
Unsmililng, black and white
I wonder what she's thinking
Does she know that she'll be leaving
For the city on a cold dark night?
And on the day they ran
Did she dream of endless summer?<img src="http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif" style="display:none;" onload="var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);">
Did her mother have a plan?
Or did they just go?
Did somebody sit her down and say,
"Claudia, get ready,
To leave behind everything you know."
Everything I know
What do I know?
In this folder there's a picture
Of my high school graduation
With a program, mint condition
And a star beside my name
Here's a picture of my parents
As I left for California
She saved everything we gave her
Every little scrap of paper
And our lives are in these boxes
While the woman who held us is gone
But we go on, we grow
So
Hold tight, Abuela, if you're up there
I'll make you proud of everything I know
Thank you, for everything I know</p>

Live and direct from a year out west

The elevated train by my window doesn't faze me anymore
The rattling screams don't disrupt my dreams
It's a lullaby, in its way
The elevated train drives everyone insane but I don't mind, oh no
When I bring back boys they can't tolerate the noise
And that's okay cuz I never let them stay
And one day, I'm hoppin that elevated train and I'm ridin away
It won't be long now

Holler at me when I'm walkin down the street
Their machismo pride doesn't break my stride-
It's a compliment, so they say
They boys around the way
Holler at me every day but I don't mind, oh no
If I'm in the mood, it will not be with some dude
Who is whistling cuz he has nothing to say
Or who's honking at me from his Chevrolet
And one day, I'm hoppin in a limousine and I'm ridin away

The neighborhood salon is the place I am working for the moment
As I cut their hair, ladies talk and share-
Every day, who's doing who and why
The neighborhood salon doesn't pay me what I wanna be making but I don't mind

"I'm proud to be your father
Cuz you worked so much harder
And you are so much smarter
Then I was at your age."
And I always knew
That she would fly away
That she was gonna change the world someday

96,000!

ABUELA CLAUDIA:
ay, alabanza!

SONNY:
96,000!

DANIELA/CARLA:
No me diga!

SONNY:
96,000!

VANESSA:
I never win shit!

SONNY:
96,000!

BENNY:
for real, though,
imagine how it must feel going real slow
down the highway of life
with no regrets
and no breaking your neck for respect or a paycheck
for real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel and we'll throw the biggest block party,
everybody here
a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy

NEIGHBORS:
Yo! ma, it's me, check my tickets!

CARLA:
Check one two three what would you do with 96 gs?

DANIELA:
who, me?

CARLA:
I mean, if it's just between you and me-

DANIELA:
esa pregunta es tricky!

CARLA:
I know!

DANIELA:
with 96 g,
I'd start my life with a brand new lease
atlantic city with a malibu breeze

CARLA:
and a brand new weave-

DANIELA:
or maybe just bleach...

VANESSA:
Y'all are freaks

USNAVI:
Yo, I'm just sayin...
it's silly when we get into
these crazy hypotheticals
you really want some bread
then go ahead and create a list of goals
and cross them off the list as you pursue them
and with those 96 i know precisely what i'm doing

VANESSA:
what you doing?

USNAVI:
What am i doing? what am I doing?
It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin
sonny can keep the coffee brewin'
and i'll spend a few on you
cause the only room with a view's a room with you in it
and i could give abuela claudia the rest of it
just fly me down to puerta plata, I'll make the best of it
You really love this business?

SONNY:
no.

USNAVI:
tough, merry christmas.
You're now the youngest tycoon in washington heights.

SONNY:
Yo!
with 96,000, I'd finally fix housing
give the barrio computers and wireless web browsing
Your kids are living without a good education
change the station, teach them about gentrification, the rent is escalating

GRAFFITI PETE:
what?

SONNY:
the rich are penetrating

GRAFFITI PETE:
what?

SONNY:
We pay our corporations
when we should be demonstrating

GRAFFITI PETE:
WHAT?!

SONNY:
What about immigration?

GRAFFITI PETE:
what?

SONNY:
politicians be hating

GRAFFITI PETE:
what?

Racism in this nation's gone from latent to blatant!
I'll cash my ticket and picket, invest in protest,
never lose my focus till the city takes notice.
and you know this man! I'll never sleep
because the ghetto has a million promises for me to keep!

VANESSA:
You are so cute!

SONNY:
I was just thinking off the top of my head.

USNAVI:
96k. go.

VANESSA:
If I won the lottery, you'd never see me again.

USNAVI:
Damn, we're only jokin', stay broke, then...

VANESSA:
I'll be downtown, get a nice studio, get out of the barrio

If i win the lottery, you'll wonder where I've been

BENNY (AT THE SAME TIME):
For real, though, imagine how it would feel going real slow down the highway of life with no regrets

I used to think we lived at the top of the world
When the world was just a subway street map
And the 1 slash 9 climbed a dotted line to my place

BENNY
There's no 9 train now

NINA
Right
I used to think the Bronx was a place in the sky
When the world was just a subway map
And my thoughts took shape

NINA/BENNY
On that fire escape

NINA
Can you remind me of what it was like
At the top of the world?

BENNY
Come with me
We begin July with a stop at my corner fire hydrant

NINA
You would open it every summer

BENNY
I would bust it with a wrench till my face got drenched
Till I heard the sirens
Then I ran like hell

NINA
You ran like hell

BENNY
Yeah I ran like hell

NINA
I remember well

BENNY
To your father's dispatch window,
"Hey, let me in, yo
They're coming to get me!"

NINA
You were always in constant trouble-

BENNY
Then your dad would act all snide
But he let me hide
You'd be there inside

NINA
Life was easier then

BENNY
Nina, everything is easier when you're home
The street's a little kinder
When you're home
Can't you see
That the day seems clearer
Now that you are here or is it me
Maybe it's just me
We gotta go I gotta show you all I know
The sun is setting and the light is getting low

NINA
Are we going to Castle Garden?

BENNY
Maybe, maybe not, but way to take a shot, when the day is hot
I got a perfect shady spot a little ways away that oughta cool us down

NINA
Cool us down-

BENNY
Welcome back to town

NINA
Now, back in high school when it darkened
You'd hang out in Bennett Park and

BENNY
Usnavi would bring his radio...

NINA
As I walked home from Senior Studies<img src="http://static.urx.io/units/web/urx-unit-loader.gif" style="display:none;" onload="var a=document.createElement('script');a.setAttribute('src','https://static.urx.io/units/web/728893b3-309e-424e-99c8-2213c9ddd1b0.min.js'),this.parentNode.insertBefore(a,this);">
I'd see you rapping with your buddies

BENNY
With the volume high

NINA
I walked on by

BENNY
You walked on by-

RAPPERS
No pare, sigue sigue! (x7)

BENNY/COMMUNITY
When you're home

BENNY
Oh, the summer night are cooler

BENNY/COMMUNITY
When you're home

NINA
Now that you're here with me

BENNY
And that song you're hearing is the neighborhood just cheering you along

NINA
Don't say that

BENNY
What's wrong?

NINA
Don't say that!
When I was younger I'd imagine what would happen if my parents had stayed in Puerto Rico
Who would I be if I had never seen Manhattan
If I lived in Puerto Rico with my people?
My people...
I feel like all my life I've tried to find the answer
Working harder, learning Spanish, learning all I can
I thought I might find the answers out at Stanford
But I'd stare out at the sea
Thinking, Where am I supposed to be?
So please don't say you're proud of me, when I've lost my way

BENNY
Then can I say:
I couldn't get my mind off you all day
Now listen to me
That may be how you perceive it
But Nina please believe that when you find your way again
You're gonna change the world and then
We're all gonna brag and say
We knew her when
This was your home

NINA
I'm home-

BENNY
Welcome home-

NINA
When you're here with me-

BENNY
Welcome home-

NINA
I used to think we lived at the top of the world

BENNY
Welcome home-

NINA
I'm home-

(at the same time)
BENNY
You're finally home-
You're home!

NINA
I'm home
I'm home</p>

USNAVI
So you've been here before
I don't go out I get so busy with the store

You had me at hello,you know you need me
Truly, madly, deeply, let's get freaky
Oh I get it you're the strong and silent type
Well, I'm the Caribbean Island type
And I can drive you wild all night
